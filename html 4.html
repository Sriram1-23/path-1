We have also ventured into the retail business with our iconic blend of Tea powder, so you can enjoy our Chai, anytime! With four outlets in Lakdikapul, Red Hills, Banjara Hills and Himayat Nagar, we are committed to making sure everyone has access to the Taste of Hyderabad!

     <P>Meet the man behind Hyderabad’s iconic Cafe Niloufer
        Babu Rao, the owner of Cafe Niloufer, has an inspiring story. He came to Hyderabad in 1975 with no money and no place to stay. He started working as a cleaner at the cafe, then became a waiter, and later learned to make tea. In 1993, after years of hard work, he became the owner.  
        
        Now, Babu Rao runs multiple outlets of the famous cafe across Hyderabad, each catering to a different crowd. He even gives back to the community by providing free meals to hundreds every day. Tea on the house! Free chai offer draws massive crowd

OUR CHAI STORY
Hyderabad’s tea lovers and enthusiasts have been a major part of our legacy, and we take immense pride in every cup. Every sip holds a taste so intense and rich, it is bound to refresh your senses. With time constantly challenging and pushing us forward, we push to travel the extra mile.

We embarked on our journey with our customers as our pillions, they’ve been a supremely important part of our milestones. Driving the heritage of ‘tea drinking’ ahead into the millennial times, we introduced two blends Platinum & Bronze into the market. To our pleasant surprise, these were loved and much appreciated by our delighted customers resulting in an incredible milestone for Niloufer.
